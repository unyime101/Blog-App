# 📝 Personal Blogging Platform (Node.js + MongoDB + Express)

A minimalist blogging platform built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **vanilla HTML/CSS** — designed for solo blogging and public engagement through comments.
Will prepare me for my final year project in advanced web development.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a personal blog web app where:

✅ Only **I** (the owner) can create, edit, and delete blog posts  
✅ Visitors can **view** blog posts and leave **comments** and offer advice  
✅ All posts and comments are stored securely in a **MongoDB database**  
✅ The frontend is styled with simple, custom **HTML/CSS** (no frameworks)

This app is designed to deepen my understanding of:

- Node.js + Express backend development  
- MongoDB data modeling  
- Cloud hosting with **Azure App Service**  
- Future deployment via **k3s on Raspberry Pi** for DevOps practice
